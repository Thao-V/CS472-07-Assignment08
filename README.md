2. Define a function called redirect() that performs the redirection.
3. Inside the redirect() function, use the prompt() function to ask the user to enter a website URL.
4. Get the entered URL from the user and store it in a variable.
5. Use the location object's assign() method to redirect the user to the specified URL.
6. Attach an event listener to the button in the HTML file, and when the button is clicked, invoke the redirect() function.
